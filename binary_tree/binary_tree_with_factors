# Binary Tree With Factors

<b>Question: Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1. We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.

How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.<br>

Example:  
Input: A = [2, 4]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
