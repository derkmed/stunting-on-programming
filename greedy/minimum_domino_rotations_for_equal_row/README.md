# Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row

<b>Question:</b>

<b>In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)</b>  
<br>
<b>We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.</b>
<br>
<b>Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.</b>
<br>
<b>If it cannot be done, return -1.</b>
