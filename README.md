Welcome. These are all the interview questions I have personally come across and/or found particularly helpful for myself for studying. 

If you're here, you're either future Derek or one of my friends who is currently on the job search. 

I recommend taking a look at categories that you may have trouble solving. Part of becoming better at these things just involves practice and pattern recognition. I've tried to summarize the necessary thought process to reach the provided solution to each problem in a manner that is as succinct as possible. This way, instead of memorizing the solution, you may find memorizing the key observations and thoughts in the thought process more helpful.

I want to be 100% clear that I do not stand for, believe in, or suggest memorizing problems & solutions, even though the software engineering interview process is horribly flawed and oftentimes a result of an engineer being pulled last-minute by a recruiter to interview a candidate and lazily ripping off of Leetcode (I've been on both sides of the table :P). 

You are more than welcome to update or add to anything if desired, but please do so in the form of a PR.
