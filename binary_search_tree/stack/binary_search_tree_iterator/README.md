# Binary Search Tree Iterator

<b>Question:</b>

<b>Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.</b>

<b>Notes:</b>
* <b>next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.</b>
* <b>You may assume that next() call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when next() is called.</b>

Thought Process:
